In this order: Idea, Technology, Product, Market, Economics, Scale. Keep your top performer happy and committed. Surprise them with bonuses, options refresh, larger scope or work. Reference check VC: talk to portfolio companies, former associates and partners. Deal directly with the decision makers at the VC. Dilution is relative; Out of cash is terminal. Always be thinking about the next round. Terms from prior rounds are hard to eliminate. Prioritize vanilla terms (no excessive liquidation preferences or ratchet), indicator of an aligned investor. Allow 6+ months for fundraising. Create urgency and scarcity.

The only failure in your twenties is inaction. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Do, fail, learn. Find every opportunity to work with the best of the best, because they will lead you to the career you want. With not enough data, some decisions must be opinion-driven, where you convince others with storytelling. Storytelling is the heart of sales and marketing. The story: you have a track record of good decisions, you analyzed risks and prepared mitigation, you truly understand your customers and their needs, and your proposal will benefit the business. People won't remember how you started but how you left. A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature. E.g. "1,000 songs in your pocket". If your company is disruptive, prepared for strong reactions and emotions. Write a press release before building products. It crystallizes what features matter. Practice delayed intuition. Research and prototype before committing. The first 25 hires come down to your vision and network. Hire seed crystals. Always start the pitching process when you don't actually need money. Keep asking what's the next step to get us to a yes? Any stock or cash you give as a commission should vest over time. Build a relationship-first sales culture. Keep meetings on track with agenda: "Let's talk about this outside the meeting, we still have lots to cover". If there was any controversial topic, the CEO should go to every board member, one-on-one, to walk them through it before the meeting. Perks should be subsidized but not free. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SaaS-Playbook-Multimillion-Dollar-Startup-Without-ebook/dp/B0CCQB26RS"> The SaaS Playbook: Build a Multimillion-Dollar Startup Without Venture Capital </a> <div class="book-desc"> Easiest way to raise funding is building a great business. Each $1,000 in MRR adds $60,000 in company value (assuming 5x multiple). To go from PMF to escape velocity: ICP, marketing channels, moats, pricing, team, strategies, funnel bottlenecks. Avoid feature requests that don't align with the product's strengths or vision. Say no to many good ideas to prioritize the best ones. Understand the problem behind customer feature requests, not just the requested solution. Compete against bigger competitors through pricing, innovative sales models, and superior product offerings. Understand reasons behind losing deals (features, pricing, compliance). Differentiate to avoid commoditization. Network effects and integrations can be effective moats. Pricing should reflect value. Underpricing can hinder growth. Expansion revenue should align with customer success and value metrics. Charge significantly more for enterprise plans. Consider freemium models only for simple, low-support, viral products. Regularly review and adjust pricing strategies. Balance marketing efforts between quick-result and long-term strategies. Track marketing effectiveness. Avoid excessive marketing spend before PMF. Qualify sales leads before demos to save time. Delegate roles not tasks when building a team. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ"> Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future </a> <div class="book-desc"> Competition is for losers. 0 to 1 is different from 1 to n.

Product itself is not defensive because of too many great engineers and second-mover advantages. Raise prices to test PMF, fund distribution and R&amp;D, and grow faster. Delegate. Audit your calendar regularly. Say no more often. Passing 50 hires, hold weekly staff meetings and start layering in HR. Empower smart people. Communicate context, not exert control. One of the cofounders should be dominant. Board members should be people who you wish to hire but are out of reach otherwise. Take a lower valuation if necessary to get the right board. Talk to board members individually for open-ended brainstorming. Key determinant of candidate conversion is how quickly you interview + make an offer. Reference check everyone: "If this person joined my company, would you join?" Spend 30–50% of their time early on (scaling from 3 to 15 people) on recruiting. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amp-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Increasing-Elevating/dp/B09QBRBKFB"> <strong>* Amp It Up: Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency, and Elevating Intensity</strong> </a> <div class="book-desc"> Raise your standards, B players drive A players out. Hire people ahead of their own curve. Hire for aptitude over experience. Give people the career opportunity of a lifetime, a huge motivation. Coaching struggling teammates to a better place is possible but rare. Regardless of open headcounts, maintain a top-talent list and check in periodically because 1) if you wait until an opening, you can only tap the then-current suboptimal supply. 2) people currently occupying these roles might leave or could not grow as fast as the company. Staff ahead of need. Recruiting never stops. Trust is earned by delivering your promises. Always underpromise and overdeliver. Publicly admit regrettable decisions, which encourages everyone to do so. Apply focus and urgency. Time kills all deals. Time introduces risks, such as new entrants. The faster we separate from the competition, the more likely we are to succeed. “Priority” is a singular word. The moment you have many, you actually have none. Great execution is rarer than great strategy. Growth trumps everything else as a driver and predictor of long-term success. Once a start-up begins showing profits, investors conclude that either it doesn't know how to invest in further growth or that it has run out of growth opportunities. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Rules-Thrive-Complex-World/dp/0544705203"> Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World </a> <div class="book-desc"> Strategy and execution are both critical. Simple rules can bridge the gap between strategy and execution. Simple rules allow people to act without deliberating every decision. E.g. how frontline medics decide who gets medical care. Simple rules drive alignment across organizations and produce better decisions than more complicated models can, particularly when time and information are limited. 4-6 is the optimal number of rules. Three types of rules: 1) Boundary rules—whether to pursue or reject an opportunity, 2) Priority rules—rank options given limited resources, 3) Stopping rules—when to reverse or exit. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blitzscaling-Lightning-Fast-Building-Massively-Companies-ebook/dp/B0791239V7"> Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies </a> <div class="book-desc"> Do the things that don't scale.

Stretch your relationship comfort zone 15% at a time. To communicate well we must express facts/cognitions and feelings/emotions. Emotions assign meaning, intensity, and importance to facts.

All returns in life—wealth, relationships, knowledge—come from compound interest. Reading is faster than listening; doing is faster than watching. If you cannot decide, the answer is no. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B07D23CFGR"> Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones </a> <div class="book-desc"> Habits are compounding and shape who we are and what we will achieve. The best way to build a habit is to make it part of your identity (I am trying to quit smoking vs. I am not a smoker), attach the new habit to existing ones, make it small (atomic), and surround yourself with people who have the habits you want. Willpower is limited; instead, design the environment to support your habits. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quit-Power-Knowing-When-Walk-ebook/dp/B09PTLY4BL"> Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away </a> <div class="book-desc"> The same grit that won Ali the championships drove him to ignore signs to quit. Constantly reevaluate after learning new info. Free up resources to pursue better opportunities. Define quitting criteria (a state and a date) before starting. The worst time to make a decision is when you're "in it." Quitting is about forecasting—decision making with uncertainty. Make decision based on probability, expectation, and distribution. There is no point building the pedestal if you can't train the monkey. Tackle the hardest part of the problem first. Pedestal-building creates the illusion of progress and sunk cost. Be wary of escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. Quitting on time feels like quitting too early. Diversify your opportunities, keep exploring even if you are comfortable. Don't wait to be forced to quit to start exploring alternatives. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Wish-Knew-When-Was-ebook/dp/B07Q83G41J"> What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20: A Crash Course on Making Your Place in the World </a> <div class="book-desc"> Grant yourself permission instead of waiting for others to do so. Cold email the people you admire. If you are not failing sometimes, you are not taking enough risks. Do not burn bridges. You are not going to like everyone and not everyone is going to like you, but there is no need for enemies. To make good decision in dilemmas, think about how you want to tell the story in a future job interview. Recognize your mistake, apologize early and profusely. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457721"> The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life </a> <div class="book-desc"> There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. You must give a fuck about something. Rude gas station attendants and boring day-time TV shows do not deserve your limited attention. Prioritize your life based on personal values. You learn what matters to you through emotions and psychological pain. Happiness is about doing, not being. Nothing is once-and-for-all. Life is full of problems. True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. </div> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Finance and Markets</h3> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto-ebook/dp/B001FA0W5W"> <strong>* Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets</strong> </a> <div class="book-desc"> We often confuse luck with skills, and noise with signals. Investment returns are unpredictable. Stay in the game. Manage risk to never get wiped out. View the past and the future with probability/uncertainty, but understand the difference between probability and expectation. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness-ebook/dp/B084HJSJJ2"> The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness </a> <div class="book-desc"> Aim to be reasonable, not rational. The highest form of wealth is the ability to do whatever wherever whenever. Note that financial independence is not exactly about maximizing returns. Few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt-ebook/dp/B00HVJB4VM"> Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt </a> <div class="book-desc"> Wall street in 2010s. High frequency trading is not market making. It creates twice the volume, no additional liquidity, and perhaps a slightly worse execution price for the public.

Metrics are numerical summary and aggregation and thus more efficient to query than logs and traces. Choose metric labels that don't have infinite cardinality. Prometheus is a metric format and storage. Prometheus storage is not horizontally scalable. Thanos, Cortex, Mimir, M3 are OSS alternatives to Prometheus storage. To scale a metrics platform: reduce cardinality using aggregation, reduce retention period, reduce resolution, reduce sampling rate, reduce query load. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D"> Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems </a> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://ec.haxx.se/"> Everything Curl </a> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure-ebook/dp/B07YP1XSZ9"> Kubernetes: Up and Running: Dive into the Future of Infrastructure </a> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Shipping-Reliable-Containers-Production-ebook/dp/B07H5VMXDC"> Docker: Up &amp; Running: Shipping Reliable Containers in Production </a> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code-ebook/dp/B07XKF258P"> Terraform: Up &amp; Running: Writing Infrastructure as Code </a> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Books I Could Not Recommend</h3> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge-ebook/dp/B002WE46UW"> The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich </a> <div class="book-desc"> Reading it felt like I just replied to a "get rich quick" email spam.
