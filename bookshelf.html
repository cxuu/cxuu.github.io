Product itself is not defensive because of too many great engineers and second-mover advantages. Raise prices to test PMF, fund distribution and R&amp;D, and grow faster. Delegate. Audit your calendar regularly. Say no more often. Passing 50 hires, hold weekly staff meetings and start layering in HR. Empower smart people. Communicate context, not exert control. One of the cofounders should be dominant. Board members should be people who you wish to hire but are out of reach otherwise. Take a lower valuation if necessary to get the right board. Talk to board members individually for open-ended brainstorming. Key determinant of candidate conversion is how quickly you interview + make an offer. Reference check everyone: "If this person joined my company, would you join?" Spend 30–50% of their time early on (scaling from 3 to 15 people) on recruiting. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Build-Unorthodox-Guide-Making-Things-ebook/dp/B09BNJ6GBV"> <strong>* Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making </strong> </a> <div class="book-desc"> Navigating job levels and politics are not real personal growth. The only failure in your twenties is inaction. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Do, fail, learn. Find every opportunity to work with the best of the best, because they will lead you to the career you want. With not enough data, some decisions must be opinion-driven, where you convince others with storytelling. Storytelling is the heart of sales and marketing. The story: you have a track record of good decisions, you analyzed risks and prepared mitigation, you truly understand your customers and their needs, and your proposal will benefit the business. People won't remember how you started but how you left. A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature. E.g. "1,000 songs in your pocket". If your company is disruptive, prepared for strong reactions and emotions. Write a press release before building products. It crystallizes what features matter. Practice delayed intuition. Research and prototype before committing. The first 25 hires come down to your vision and network. Hire seed crystals. Always start the pitching process when you don't actually need money. Keep asking what's the next step to get us to a yes? Any stock or cash you give as a commission should vest over time. Build a relationship-first sales culture. Keep meetings on track with agenda: "Let's talk about this outside the meeting, we still have lots to cover". If there was any controversial topic, the CEO should go to every board member, one-on-one, to walk them through it before the meeting. Perks should be subsidized but not free. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Sand-Hill-Road-Venture-ebook/dp/B07MQT97PV"> Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital and How to Get It </a> <div class="book-desc"> VC returns follow power-law distribution, so VC needs nontrivial allocations in home-run winners operating in huge markets. Connect with VC through relationships. Cold emails hardly work. For series-A term sheets, push for having the capital "P" Preferred vote on voluntary conversion. Avoid board observers, because they might chime in discussions and their presence crowds the room and discourages straight talks. Preferred and common investors are not always aligned, particularly with acquisitions + liquidation preferences. The Board has fiduciary duty only the common shareholders. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Straight-Talk-Startups-Odds-Fundamentals-ebook/dp/B0791CFHX5"> Straight Talk for Startups: 100 Insider Rules for Beating the Odds </a> <div class="book-desc"> Aim for an order-of-magnitude improvement. Hire part-time experts rather than full-time trainees. Track unit economics and working capital. Conduct early, low-cost tests of your ideas. In this order: Idea, Technology, Product, Market, Economics, Scale. Keep your top performer happy and committed. Surprise them with bonuses, options refresh, larger scope or work. Reference check VC: talk to portfolio companies, former associates and partners. Deal directly with the decision makers at the VC. Dilution is relative; Out of cash is terminal. Always be thinking about the next round. Terms from prior rounds are hard to eliminate. Prioritize vanilla terms (no excessive liquidation preferences or ratchet), indicator of an aligned investor. Allow 6+ months for fundraising. Create urgency and scarcity. Don't share who else you are talking to. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://handbooks.clerky.com/startup-incorporation"> Startup Incorporation for Founders </a> <div class="book-desc"> Delaware C Corp for startups.

Simple rules can bridge the gap between strategy and execution. Simple rules allow people to act without deliberating every decision. E.g. how frontline medics decide who gets medical care. Simple rules drive alignment across organizations and produce better decisions than more complicated models can, particularly when time and information are limited. 4-6 is the optimal number of rules. Three types of rules: 1) Boundary rules—whether to pursue or reject an opportunity, 2) Priority rules—rank options given limited resources, 3) Stopping rules—when to reverse or exit. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ"> Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future </a> <div class="book-desc"> Competition is for losers. 0 to 1 is different from 1 to n.

Wealth comes from judgment. Play long-term games with long-term people. Find a worthy mate; be worthy of a worthy mate. Find work that feels like play. All returns in life—wealth, relationships, knowledge—come from compound interest. Reading is faster than listening; doing is faster than watching.

Stretch your relationship comfort zone 15% at a time. To communicate well we must express facts/cognitions and feelings/emotions. Emotions assign meaning, intensity, and importance to facts.

Elaborate my emotions, and listen to theirs. Intentions, emotions, and identities are complex. I cannot control but prepare for others' reaction. Explore joint contributions to the dispute. Start with mines to avoid their defensiveness, but include theirs. People want to be heard.

Constantly reevaluate after learning new info. Free up resources to pursue better opportunities. Define quitting criteria (a state and a date) before starting. The worst time to make a decision is when you're "in it." Quitting is about forecasting—decision making with uncertainty. Make decision based on probability, expectation, and distribution. There is no point building the pedestal if you can't train the monkey. Tackle the hardest part of the problem first. Pedestal-building creates the illusion of progress and sunk cost. Be wary of escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. Quitting on time feels like quitting too early. Diversify your opportunities, keep exploring even if you are comfortable.

Cold email the people you admire. If you are not failing sometimes, you are not taking enough risks. Do not burn bridges. You are not going to like everyone and not everyone is going to like you, but there is no need for enemies.

Hire people ahead of their own curve. Hire for aptitude over experience. Give people the career opportunity of a lifetime, a huge motivation. Coaching struggling teammates to a better place is possible but rare. Regardless of open headcounts, maintain a top-talent list and check in periodically because 1) if you wait until an opening, you can only tap the then-current suboptimal supply. 2) people currently occupying these roles might leave or could not grow as fast as the company. Staff ahead of need. Recruiting never stops. Trust is earned by delivering your promises. Always underpromise and overdeliver. Publicly admit regrettable decisions, which encourages everyone to do so. Apply focus and urgency. Time kills all deals. Time introduces risks, such as new entrants. The faster we separate from the competition, the more likely we are to succeed. “Priority” is a singular word. The moment you have many, you actually have none. Great execution is rarer than great strategy. Growth trumps everything else as a driver and predictor of long-term success. Once a start-up begins showing profits, investors conclude that either it doesn't know how to invest in further growth or that it has run out of growth opportunities. </div> </div> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F"> The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change </a> <div class="book-desc"> Be kind, not nice. Practice continuous feedback. Delegate. Listen. Empathize. Build personal connections. Praise in public; criticize in private. What you measure, you improve. Set expectations.

Direct reports watch everything you do ("toxic tandem"). Watch your tone of voice, the way you look at people, the use of nicknames, a memory for faces, names and dates. These details refine your relationships. Effective leaders are both competent and benevolent. Humans prefer hierarchical relationships. The challenge is not to reinvent management but dampen known drawbacks. </div> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Career Growth</h3> <div class="book-entry"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Said-Communicating-Better-Beyond/dp/1119285283"> Simply Said: Communicating Better at Work and Beyond </a> <div class="book-desc"> Prioritize the audience needs. Use simple, concise words. Vocal variety (volume, speed, tone) maintains listener engagement. When presenting, explain what the audience is looking at before elaborating. Avoid "inside jokes" or references that may exclude parts of your audience. Listening is more powerful than speaking. Take notes, ask follow-ups, maintain eye contact.

You can't avoid it. Use politics to get more things done. Look for personal similarities that make it easier for you to connect professionally to your colleagues and boss. Don't slip down to your colleague’s level, always take a higher road, call your colleague on the bad behavior. Build positive relationship with your boss instead of looking for ways to dethrone the pet. Build a network outside of your employer. To be looped in big projects, express interest in them. "I know I’m not on that assignment, but could I sit in on a status meeting to learn more about it?’" Once you’re in the room, offer to pitch in. Raise your hand for any role to start with. Very few people rise to the top of their profession without allies. Form more than one allies. It is critical to have them backing your promotion. Build relationships before you need them. Transparency builds trust. Don’t align yourself too strongly or permanently with anyone. Review and prune alliances. Escalate peer conflicts to your boss as a last resort: “John, I don’t think you and I are getting anywhere trying to resolve this issue.
